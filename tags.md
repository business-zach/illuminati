# Introduction
In Lightspeed, we consider two things to be true: 1. You are not a computer and 2. You want to find your items quickly and easily.  To help with both of these facts we've built tags into the system.  Tags let you group together and report upon items or customers in multiple ways beyond the initial scope of the softare.  While categories, vendors, manufacturers, customer types, and names are all useful descriptors there is a vast world out there.  You can capture some of this world with tags.

Basically tha twe understand that people are not computers, and like to find things.  this is a weird statement to start to make .  maybe instead that thatere are multiple ways to identify or organize anything.  It's a beautiful pluralistic world.  there are multiple life is a beautiful patchwork.  What you may call "a UX200 p-4" your inventory manager may call "the heavy thing that sits on the bottom shelf" and your customer may call "my dream item."  The world is an incredible patchwork of perspectives, names, and organizing principles.  Which could make finding or reporting upon anything incredibly hard.

Lightspeed supports the pluralistic universe through the concept of tags.  With tags, you can add multiple identifiers to an item or customer, to group various things together in ways beyond the initial scope of the software.  Now an item can be part of the clothing category, AND the summer collection, and ALSO heavy things.  
# Benefits
-** Expand the breadth and versatility of reporting**
The majority of our reports let you filter by tags.  You can use this to either include or exclude items from the list,, based on multiple tags.  
- **Organize your inventory and customers  in multiple ways**
A good way to think about tags is that they group things in your store in a way that carries across categories or vendors. For example, it is understandable that shirts are in a different category from eyeglasses...but there may still be some quality that links these two items together.  Perhaps they are both part of your Spring line.  Or perhaps you'd classify them both as "favorites".

Similarly, you may want to group customers together by multiple qualities.  Like how they were referred to your store, or wheather they are club members of any sort.  Since you decide the names of each tag, and can add multiple ones to a customer or item, you have the flexibility to get specific in as many ways as you'd like.
